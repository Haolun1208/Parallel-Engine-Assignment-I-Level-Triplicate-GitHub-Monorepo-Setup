When importing Kenney assets and building the same level in Unity, Unreal, and Godot, one striking similarity I noticed was that all three engines offered a relatively smooth asset import process. Kenney assets were correctly recognized in each engine, and the process of placing models into the scene for initial level construction was largely consistent, including importing assets, organizing folder structures, and visual construction within the editor. This makes it relatively easy to transfer basic level design ideas between different engines without completely restructuring the workflow.

A noticeable difference lies in the "visual construction experience." Unity and Unreal both allow direct asset previewing in the editor, enabling quick browsing, selection, and placement of models during level construction, resulting in a more intuitive and fluid overall process. In contrast, Godot often requires double-clicking or opening resources for effective previewing, which disrupts visual continuity during actual level construction, making asset browsing and placement slower and less intuitive. Secondly, Unity and Godot feel lighter and simpler overall, but sometimes require more manual adjustments or extra steps when placing objects or managing the scene. In comparison, Unreal provides clearer visual feedback and more comprehensive editor tools, making the level construction process feel more structured and directed. In terms of navigation, object manipulation, and scene organization, Unreal's overall experience is more consistent and smoother than the other two engines.

Regarding instantiation mechanisms, Unity's Prefab, Unreal's Blueprint Actor, and Godot's PackedScene are essentially used to create reusable objects and generate consistent instances within the level. While the core concept is the same, Unreal's Blueprint Actor is more powerful and explicit in its functional expression and logical presentation, while Prefab and PackedScene lean towards a lighter, simpler user experience.

If I needed to rebuild the same level again, I would choose Unreal because it performs the most clearly and comfortably in terms of logical structure and visual operation.
